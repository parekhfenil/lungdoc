## Affordable Quality Care

We understand that not everyone has insurance coverage. For self-pay patients, we offer:
- Transparent pricing
- Competitive cash rates for consultations
- Payment options

## Don't Delay Care
Delaying treatment for conditions like asthma or COPD can lead to expensive ER visits. An office visit is a much more affordable way to manage your health.
