## What is a Home Sleep Test?

A home sleep test (also called home sleep apnea testing or HSAT) is a convenient way to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea without spending the night in a sleep lab.

We provide you with a small, easy-to-use device that you wear overnight while sleeping in your own bed. The device monitors your breathing, oxygen levels, and other data while you sleep normally.

## Who is a Candidate for Home Sleep Testing?

Home sleep testing is appropriate for most adults suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea. It's especially suitable if you:

- Have symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime sleepiness)
- Don't have significant heart or lung disease
- Are not taking sedative medications

Some patients may still need an in-lab sleep study for more comprehensive evaluation.
