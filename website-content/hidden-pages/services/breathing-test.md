## What is a PFT?

A Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) is a non-invasive breathing test that measures:
- How much air your lungs can hold
- How fast you can blow air out
- How well oxygen transfers into your blood

## Why Do I Need It?
It is the gold standard for diagnosing asthma, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis, and for monitoring lung health over time.

## Fast & Convenient
We have PFT labs in both our Corona and Lake Elsinore offices, so you don't have to go to a hospital.
