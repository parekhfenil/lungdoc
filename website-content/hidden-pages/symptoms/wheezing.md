## What Causes Wheezing?

Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing. It usually indicates narrowed airways from:
- Asthma
- COPD
- Bronchitis
- Allergies

## Don't Ignore It
Wheezing is a sign your lungs are struggling. We can perform breathing tests (spirometry) to identify the cause and provide inhalers or other treatments to open your airways.
