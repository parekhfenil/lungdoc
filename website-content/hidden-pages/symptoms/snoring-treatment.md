## Is Your Snoring Dangerous?

Occasional light snoring is common and usually harmless. But loud, chronic snoring—especially if accompanied by gasping, choking, or pauses in breathing—could be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

### Signs your snoring may be sleep apnea:

- Loud snoring that can be heard through walls
- Snoring interrupted by silent pauses
- Gasping or choking during sleep
- Waking up with headaches
- Excessive daytime sleepiness
- Difficulty concentrating

### Why it matters:

Untreated sleep apnea increases your risk of:
- High blood pressure
- Heart attack
- Stroke
- Type 2 diabetes
- Car accidents from drowsy driving
