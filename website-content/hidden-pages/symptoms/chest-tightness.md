## Causes of Chest Tightness

*Note: If you have sudden, severe chest pain, call 911.*

For chronic or recurring tightness, the cause is often respiratory:
- **Asthma:** Feeling like a band is tightening around the chest.
- **Anxiety:** Hyperventilation can cause tightness.
- **Muscle Strain:** From coughing.

## We Can Help
We use PFTs and physical exams to determine if your tightness is lung-related and treat it effectively.
