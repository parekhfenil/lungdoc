## When a Cough Won't Quit

A cough lasting more than 8 weeks is considered chronic. It can be exhausting and disrupt your life. Common causes include:
- Post-nasal drip
- Asthma (Cough-variant)
- Acid reflux (GERD)
- Medication side effects

## Our Approach
We systematically evaluate the potential causes to stop the cough at its source, rather than just suppressing it.
