## What is a Lung Nodule?

A lung nodule (also called a pulmonary nodule) is a small, round growth in the lung that appears on imaging studies like CT scans or X-rays. While the discovery of a lung nodule can be alarming, **most lung nodules are benign (non-cancerous)**.

However, proper evaluation is essential to rule out lung cancer or other serious conditions. At Inland Pulmonary Specialists, we provide thorough evaluation and clear guidance so you know exactly what's going on.

## Common Causes of Lung Nodules

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Granulomas** | Scarring from previous infections (most common cause) |
| **Benign Tumors (Hamartomas)** | Non-cancerous growths |
| **Fungal Infections** | Including Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis), common in Southern California |
| **Lymph Nodes** | Sometimes visible on CT scans |
| **Lung Cancer or Metastatic Disease** | Less common, but why evaluation is important |
| **Inflammatory Conditions** | Such as sarcoidosis or rheumatoid arthritis |

## Our Evaluation Process

We follow evidence-based guidelines to evaluate your nodule:

1. **Review of Imaging Studies** - Careful analysis of size, shape, and characteristics
2. **Risk Assessment** - Based on nodule features and your personal risk factors
3. **PET/CT Scan** - When indicated for larger or suspicious nodules
4. **Comparison with Previous Imaging** - Checking for growth or stability
5. **Biopsy Referral** - If tissue diagnosis is needed
6. **Surveillance Planning** - For low-risk nodules, monitoring over time

---

## When Monitoring is Recommended

For small, low-risk nodules, we typically recommend:

- **Small nodules (<6mm)** with low-risk features may need only one follow-up scan
- **Serial CT scans** at recommended intervals (typically 6-12 months)
- **Assessment for growth or changes** over time

Most benign nodules will remain stable and eventually no longer require monitoring.

## When Further Testing is Needed

We recommend additional testing for:

- **Larger nodules (>8mm)** - Higher risk of malignancy
- **Nodules with concerning features** - Irregular edges, spiculated appearance
- **High-risk patients** - Smoking history, family history of lung cancer
- **Growing nodules** - Any nodule that increases in size

## Peace of Mind

We understand that learning you have a lung nodule can be stressful. Our goal is to provide:

- **Clear explanations** of what your imaging shows
- **Honest assessment** of your risk level
- **Evidence-based recommendations** following national guidelines
- **Timely follow-up** so you never fall through the cracks

**Over 90% of small lung nodules found incidentally on CT scans are benign.**

## FAQ Section

### Should I be worried about a lung nodule?

Most lung nodules are benign (non-cancerous). In fact, over 90% of small nodules found incidentally on CT scans turn out to be harmless. However, proper evaluation is important to ensure nothing is missed. Our role is to assess your specific situation and create an appropriate follow-up plan so you can have peace of mind.

### What makes a nodule suspicious?

Factors that increase concern include larger size (greater than 8mm), irregular or spiculated edges, rapid growth compared to previous scans, location in the upper lobes, and patient risk factors such as smoking history, age over 50, or personal/family history of cancer. We evaluate all these factors together.

### How often will I need follow-up CT scans?

This depends on the nodule's size, characteristics, and your individual risk factors. Small, low-risk nodules may need annual follow-up, while larger or higher-risk nodules may require scans every 3-6 months initially. We follow established guidelines to minimize unnecessary radiation while ensuring timely detection of any changes.

### What is Valley Fever and how does it cause lung nodules?

Valley Fever (coccidioidomycosis) is a fungal infection common in Southern California, Arizona, and other desert regions. The fungus lives in soil and becomes airborne when disturbed. When inhaled, it can cause infection that leaves behind granulomas—small nodules in the lungs. These are benign but can be concerning on imaging until properly evaluated.
