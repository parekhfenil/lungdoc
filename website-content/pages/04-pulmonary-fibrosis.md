## What is Pulmonary Fibrosis?

Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease characterized by scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue. This scarring makes it increasingly difficult for oxygen to pass from the lungs into the bloodstream, leading to shortness of breath and reduced exercise capacity.

At Inland Pulmonary Specialists, we provide comprehensive diagnosis and treatment to slow disease progression and help you maintain the best possible quality of life. While there is no cure, new treatments have shown promise in slowing the disease.

## Types We Treat

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)** | The most common form; cause unknown |
| **Connective Tissue Disease-Related** | Associated with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus |
| **Drug-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis** | Caused by certain medications (chemotherapy, heart drugs) |
| **Radiation-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis** | Following radiation therapy for cancer |
| **Environmental/Occupational** | From exposure to asbestos, silica, coal dust, or mold |

## Symptoms

Pulmonary fibrosis symptoms often develop gradually:

- ✗ Progressive shortness of breath (the most common symptom)
- ✗ Dry, hacking cough that doesn't go away
- ✗ Fatigue and weakness
- ✗ Unexplained weight loss
- ✗ Clubbing of fingers and toes (rounded, widened fingertips)
- ✗ Muscle and joint aches

**If you notice increasing breathlessness, especially with activities that didn't previously cause problems, see a pulmonologist.**

## Diagnostic Approach

Accurate diagnosis is crucial. We use:

1. **High-Resolution CT Scan (HRCT)** - The most important imaging test for pulmonary fibrosis
2. **Pulmonary Function Testing** - Measuring lung capacity and oxygen transfer
3. **Six-Minute Walk Test** - Assessing exercise capacity and oxygen needs
4. **Blood Tests** - Including autoimmune markers to identify underlying causes
5. **Multidisciplinary Discussion** - Complex cases reviewed by specialists
6. **Bronchoscopy** - When indicated for tissue sampling

## Treatment Options

### Antifibrotic Medications
- **Pirfenidone (Esbriet)** - Slows progression of IPF
- **Nintedanib (Ofev)** - Reduces the rate of lung function decline
- Both medications have been shown to slow disease progression

### Supportive Therapies
- **Oxygen therapy** - As needed to maintain adequate oxygen levels
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation** - Exercise and education programs
- **Nutritional support** - Maintaining healthy weight is important

### Advanced Options
- **Clinical trial opportunities** - Access to emerging treatments
- **Lung transplant evaluation referral** - For select candidates

## FAQ Section

### What causes pulmonary fibrosis?

In many cases, the cause is unknown (called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or IPF). Known causes include autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma), long-term exposure to toxins (asbestos, silica dust), certain medications, radiation therapy, and some infections. Our diagnostic process helps identify potential causes when possible.

### How fast does pulmonary fibrosis progress?

The progression rate varies significantly from person to person. Some patients remain stable for years, while others experience more rapid decline. Regular monitoring helps us track your disease progression and adjust treatment accordingly. Early diagnosis and treatment with antifibrotic medications can help slow the progression.

### Can pulmonary fibrosis be treated?

While there is no cure, antifibrotic medications (pirfenidone and nintedanib) have been shown to slow disease progression in IPF. Oxygen therapy helps maintain quality of life, and pulmonary rehabilitation improves exercise tolerance. For select patients, lung transplantation may be an option.

### What is the life expectancy with pulmonary fibrosis?

This varies greatly depending on the type and severity of pulmonary fibrosis, overall health, and response to treatment. Many patients live for years with proper management. Our goal is to slow progression, maintain your quality of life, and help you continue doing what you enjoy.
