## Why Lung Cancer Screening Matters

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. But here's the good news: **when caught early, lung cancer is often treatable**.

Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening can detect lung cancer at its earliest, most curable stages—before symptoms appear. Studies show that annual screening reduces lung cancer deaths by up to 20% in high-risk individuals.

## Who Should Be Screened?

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual lung cancer screening for adults who meet ALL of the following criteria:

| Criteria | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Age** | 50-80 years old |
| **Smoking History** | 20 pack-year history or more |
| **Current Status** | Currently smoke OR quit within the past 15 years |

### What is a Pack-Year?

Pack-years = (Packs per day) × (Years smoked)

Examples:
- 1 pack/day for 20 years = 20 pack-years ✓
- 2 packs/day for 10 years = 20 pack-years ✓
- ½ pack/day for 40 years = 20 pack-years ✓

## FAQ Section

### What is a pack-year?

A pack-year is calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years smoked. For example, smoking 1 pack per day for 20 years = 20 pack-years. Smoking 2 packs per day for 10 years also = 20 pack-years. You need 20 pack-years to qualify for screening.

### Is the radiation from CT scans dangerous?

Low-dose CT scans use about 75% less radiation than a standard chest CT. The small radiation exposure is considered safe and is far outweighed by the benefit of detecting lung cancer early. For eligible high-risk individuals, the benefits of screening clearly outweigh the minimal radiation risk.

### What happens if the scan shows something?

Many abnormal findings turn out to be benign (non-cancerous). If something is found, we'll explain what it means and recommend next steps, which may include monitoring with follow-up scans, additional imaging like a PET scan, or in some cases, a biopsy. We guide you through every step.

### Do I qualify if I quit smoking years ago?

Yes, if you quit within the past 15 years and meet the other criteria (age 50-80, 20+ pack-year history). Even though your risk decreases after quitting, former smokers remain at elevated risk for many years. Screening can still save lives in this group.

### Is lung cancer screening covered by insurance?

Yes, Medicare and most private insurance plans cover annual lung cancer screening at no cost for eligible patients. We can help verify your coverage and eligibility before scheduling your scan.
