## What is Pulmonary Hypertension?

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and the right side of the heart. Unlike regular high blood pressure, PH specifically impacts the blood vessels in your lungs, making your heart work harder to pump blood through them.

If left untreated, pulmonary hypertension can lead to heart failure. Early diagnosis and proper management are crucial for maintaining quality of life.

## Types of Pulmonary Hypertension (WHO Groups)

| Group | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Group 1** | Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) | Primary disease of the lung arteries |
| **Group 2** | PH due to left heart disease | Most common type, caused by heart conditions |
| **Group 3** | PH due to lung disease | Related to COPD, ILD, or other lung conditions |
| **Group 4** | Chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH) | Caused by blood clots in the lungs |
| **Group 5** | PH with unclear/multifactorial mechanisms | Multiple or unknown causes |

## Symptoms

Pulmonary hypertension symptoms often develop gradually:

- ✗ Shortness of breath, especially during activity
- ✗ Fatigue and weakness
- ✗ Chest pain or pressure
- ✗ Rapid heartbeat or palpitations
- ✗ Swelling in ankles, legs, and abdomen
- ✗ Bluish color of lips and skin (cyanosis)
- ✗ Dizziness or fainting spells

**These symptoms can mimic other conditions, making proper diagnosis essential.**

## Diagnostic Approach

We use comprehensive testing to diagnose and classify pulmonary hypertension:

1. **Echocardiogram** - First-line test to estimate pulmonary pressures
2. **Right Heart Catheterization Referral** - The gold standard for PH diagnosis
3. **Pulmonary Function Testing** - Assessing underlying lung disease
4. **Six-Minute Walk Test** - Measuring functional capacity
5. **Blood Tests** - Including BNP/NT-proBNP and autoimmune markers
6. **CT Angiography** - Looking for blood clots
7. **Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) Scan** - Ruling out chronic clots (CTEPH)

## Treatment Options

### Medications
- **Vasodilator medications** - Relax and widen blood vessels
- **Endothelin receptor antagonists** - Block vessel-narrowing hormone
- **PDE-5 inhibitors** - Improve blood flow in lungs
- **Prostacyclin analogues** - Advanced therapy for PAH
- **sGC stimulators** - New class of PH medications

### Supportive Therapies
- **Oxygen therapy** - As needed to maintain adequate levels
- **Diuretics** - Reduce fluid buildup and swelling
- **Anticoagulation** - When indicated, especially for CTEPH

### Advanced Care
- **Referral to specialized PH centers** - For complex cases
- **Surgical evaluation** - For CTEPH (pulmonary endarterectomy)

## FAQ Section

### Is pulmonary hypertension the same as regular high blood pressure?

No, they are different conditions. Regular high blood pressure (systemic hypertension) affects the arteries throughout your body and is measured with a blood pressure cuff. Pulmonary hypertension specifically affects the blood vessels in your lungs and requires specialized testing like an echocardiogram to detect.

### What causes pulmonary hypertension?

There are many causes, which is why PH is classified into 5 groups. Causes include heart conditions (left heart disease is most common), chronic lung diseases like COPD or ILD, blood clots in the lungs, and sometimes the cause is unknown (idiopathic PAH). Some cases are hereditary or related to certain medications.

### Can pulmonary hypertension be cured?

While most forms of pulmonary hypertension cannot be cured, they can be effectively managed with medications that help relax and widen blood vessels, reduce fluid buildup, and improve heart function. Some causes, like blood clots (CTEPH), may be treated with surgery. Early treatment leads to better outcomes.

### What lifestyle changes help with pulmonary hypertension?

Helpful changes include maintaining a low-sodium diet, staying as active as your doctor recommends, avoiding high altitudes, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, and getting adequate rest. We'll provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
