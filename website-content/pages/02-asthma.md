## What is Asthma?

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. At Inland Pulmonary Specialists, we provide comprehensive asthma care tailored to each patient's unique needs.

Our board-certified pulmonologists work with you to identify your triggers, optimize your medications, and develop an action plan so you can live an active, healthy life without being limited by your asthma.

## FAQ Section

### What triggers asthma attacks?

Common asthma triggers include allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold), respiratory infections, cold air, exercise, air pollution, strong odors, smoke, and stress. Identifying your personal triggers is key to managing your asthma effectively. Our team helps you develop strategies to minimize exposure to your specific triggers.

### Can asthma be cured?

While there is currently no cure for asthma, it can be very effectively managed with the right treatment plan. Many patients achieve excellent control of their symptoms and live active, healthy lives. With proper medication, trigger avoidance, and regular monitoring, most people with asthma can minimize symptoms and prevent attacks.

### How often should I see a pulmonologist for asthma?

For well-controlled asthma, we typically recommend visits every 3-6 months to review your symptoms, medications, and lung function. If your asthma is newly diagnosed, severe, or not well-controlled, you may need more frequent visits. We'll work with you to create a follow-up schedule that fits your needs.

### Is asthma hereditary?

There is a strong genetic component to asthma. If one or both parents have asthma, their children are more likely to develop it. However, having a family history doesn't guarantee you'll have asthma, and many people without family history still develop the condition. Environmental factors also play a significant role.
