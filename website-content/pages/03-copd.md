## What is COPD?

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that makes breathing difficult. It includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, often caused by long-term exposure to lung irritants, primarily cigarette smoke.

At Inland Pulmonary Specialists, our team provides expert COPD management to help slow disease progression and improve your quality of life. With proper treatment, many patients with COPD continue to lead active, fulfilling lives.

## Types of COPD

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Emphysema** | Damage to the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, reducing oxygen exchange |
| **Chronic Bronchitis** | Long-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes, causing excess mucus |
| **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Related COPD** | A rare genetic form of COPD; we can test for this |

## Symptoms of COPD

COPD develops gradually. Watch for these signs:

- ✗ Progressive shortness of breath (especially with activity)
- ✗ Chronic cough with mucus production
- ✗ Wheezing
- ✗ Frequent respiratory infections
- ✗ Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance
- ✗ Unintended weight loss (in advanced stages)
- ✗ Swelling in ankles, feet, or legs

**Early diagnosis and treatment can slow COPD progression significantly.**

1. **Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT)** - The gold standard for COPD diagnosis
2. **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis** - Measuring oxygen and carbon dioxide levels
3. **CT Scan of the Chest** - Detailed imaging to assess lung damage
4. **Six-Minute Walk Test** - Evaluating exercise capacity
5. **COPD Staging (GOLD Criteria)** - Determining disease severity to guide treatment
6. **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Testing** - Ruling out genetic causes

## FAQ Section

### What causes COPD?

The primary cause of COPD is long-term exposure to lung irritants, with cigarette smoking being the most common cause (responsible for about 85-90% of cases). Other causes include long-term exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, dust, and in rare cases, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

### Can COPD be reversed?

While COPD cannot be reversed or cured, its progression can be slowed significantly with proper treatment. Quitting smoking is the single most important step. With medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, and lifestyle changes, many patients maintain good quality of life and reduce the frequency of flare-ups.

### How is COPD different from asthma?

While both conditions affect the airways, COPD typically develops in adults over 40 with a history of smoking and causes permanent lung damage. Asthma often starts in childhood, is usually triggered by allergens, and airway obstruction is largely reversible. Some patients have features of both conditions ("asthma-COPD overlap").

### When do I need supplemental oxygen?

Oxygen therapy is prescribed when blood oxygen levels fall below a certain threshold, typically measured by a blood test or overnight oxygen monitoring. Not everyone with COPD needs oxygen. Our team will monitor your oxygen levels and recommend supplemental oxygen if and when it becomes necessary for your health.
