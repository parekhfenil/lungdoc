## What is Interstitial Lung Disease?

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) refers to a group of over 200 disorders that cause progressive scarring (fibrosis) of lung tissue. The interstitium is the tissue and space around the air sacs of the lungs. When this area becomes damaged or scarred, breathing becomes increasingly difficult.

At Inland Pulmonary Specialists, we have expertise in diagnosing and managing these complex conditions, working to slow progression and maintain your quality of life.

## Types of ILD We Treat

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)** | Most common form; cause unknown |
| **Sarcoidosis** | Granulomatous disease affecting lungs and other organs |
| **Rheumatoid Lung Disease** | ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis |
| **Scleroderma-Related ILD** | Associated with systemic sclerosis |
| **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis** | From inhaling organic dusts, molds, or chemicals |
| **Drug-Induced ILD** | Caused by certain medications |
| **Occupational Lung Diseases** | Asbestosis, silicosis, coal workers' pneumoconiosis |
| **Connective Tissue Disease-Associated ILD** | Related to autoimmune conditions |

## Symptoms

ILD symptoms typically develop gradually:

- ✗ Progressive shortness of breath (main symptom)
- ✗ Dry, persistent cough
- ✗ Fatigue and weakness
- ✗ Unexplained weight loss
- ✗ Chest discomfort or aching

**If you notice increasing breathlessness, especially with activities you could do before, see a pulmonologist.**

## Our Specialized Approach

Diagnosing ILD requires careful detective work:

1. **Comprehensive History** - Occupational, environmental, and medication exposure review
2. **High-Resolution CT (HRCT) Imaging** - The most important imaging test
3. **Pulmonary Function Testing** - Measuring lung volumes and gas transfer
4. **Autoimmune Blood Panel** - Screening for underlying autoimmune conditions
5. **Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)** - Analyzing cells from the lungs
6. **Multidisciplinary Team Discussion** - Complex cases reviewed by specialists
7. **Collaboration with Rheumatology** - For autoimmune-related ILD

## Treatment Options

### Medications
- **Anti-inflammatory medications** - Corticosteroids and others
- **Immunosuppressive therapy** - For autoimmune-related ILD
- **Antifibrotic medications** - Pirfenidone and nintedanib for IPF and some other ILDs

### Supportive Care
- **Oxygen therapy** - As needed to maintain adequate levels
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation** - Exercise and education programs
- **Nutritional support** - Maintaining healthy weight

### Advanced Options
- **Clinical trial opportunities** - Access to emerging treatments
- **Lung transplant evaluation** - For select candidates

## FAQ Section

### What is the difference between ILD and pulmonary fibrosis?

Pulmonary fibrosis is a type of ILD. The term "Interstitial Lung Disease" is an umbrella term that includes over 200 different lung conditions that cause inflammation or scarring. Pulmonary fibrosis specifically refers to conditions where scarring (fibrosis) is the primary feature.

### What causes interstitial lung disease?

Causes include autoimmune conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, lupus), occupational exposures (asbestos, silica, coal dust), certain medications, radiation therapy, and infections. In many cases, particularly IPF, the cause remains unknown despite thorough evaluation.

### Is ILD the same as sarcoidosis?

Sarcoidosis is one type of ILD. It's characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in the lungs and sometimes other organs. Unlike some other ILDs, sarcoidosis may resolve on its own in some patients and doesn't always cause permanent scarring.

### Can I still exercise with ILD?

Yes, in fact, staying active is beneficial for most ILD patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs, which include supervised exercise, are an important part of treatment. Your doctor will help determine safe activity levels based on your condition. Some patients exercise with supplemental oxygen if needed.
