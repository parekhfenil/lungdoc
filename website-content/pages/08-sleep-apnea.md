## What is Sleep Apnea?

Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. These pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes and may occur 30 times or more per hour.

Left untreated, sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and daytime fatigue that affects your quality of life and safety. Our specialists provide comprehensive diagnosis and treatment to help you sleep better and live healthier.

## FAQ Section

### How do I know if I have sleep apnea?

Common signs include loud snoring, observed pauses in breathing during sleep, gasping or choking awake, excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep time, morning headaches, and difficulty concentrating. A sleep study (either at home or in a lab) is needed for diagnosis.

### Can I do a sleep study at home?

Yes! Home sleep apnea testing is convenient and accurate for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea in most patients. You wear a simple device overnight in your own bed. Some complex cases may still require an in-lab study. We'll help determine which option is right for you.

### Will I have to use CPAP forever?

CPAP is currently the most effective treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea, and most patients will need ongoing therapy. However, some patients may reduce their CPAP dependence through significant weight loss or, in select cases, surgery. We'll work with you to find sustainable solutions.

### What if I can't tolerate CPAP?

Many CPAP tolerance issues can be resolved with mask fitting adjustments, different mask styles, humidification settings, or pressure adjustments. We work closely with patients to troubleshoot problems. For those who truly cannot use CPAP, alternatives include oral appliances or surgical options.

### Does sleep apnea cause other health problems?

Yes, untreated sleep apnea significantly increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and depression. It also increases the risk of accidents due to daytime drowsiness. Treating sleep apnea can reduce these risks and improve overall health.
